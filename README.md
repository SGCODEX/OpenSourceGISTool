# Open Source GIS Tool

Summary:
The "Open Source GIS Tool" aims to develop a user-friendly and accessible GIS tool to help users use geospatial information and geographic data to solve real-world problems. The tool will empower urban planners, engineers, policymakers, and community stakeholders to identify suitable locations for various projects (like sustainable water management, efficient resource distribution, goods storage, other location-based projects etc.) and design their plans accordingly. By integrating geospatial data and advanced analytical capabilities, the tool will facilitate informed decision-making, optimize resource allocation and promote community participation. Emphasizing openness, scalability, and user-centric design, the project seeks to foster collaboration, capacity building and policy influence to address real-world problems and provide an intuitive and ready-to-use GIS platform for Indian cities and abroad.
